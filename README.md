üß™ An open-source SDK for building and experimenting with customizable governance mechanisms and capital allocation strategies. Built on Scaffold-ETH-2 and integrated with Allo Protocol v2.1, CiviKit makes it easier for developers to create, test, and deploy governance systems for DAOs and grant programs.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Scaffold-ETH-2, Allo Protocol, EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service), NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, and Typescript.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/Novus-Initium/Civikit
cd Civikit
yarn install
```

2. Add Pinata API Keys and Gateway in your packages/nextjs/.env

- PINATA_API_KEY=
- PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
- PINATA_GATEWAY=

3. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.



4. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

5. In the Next folder, find the env.example to connect to an IPFS gateway and API key to submit and retrieve data to render the UI faster at scale. 

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app's homepage in config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

**What's next**:

- Edit your smart contracts controlling capital allocation and grants management` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your smart contract test in: `packages/hardhat/test`. To run test use `yarn hardhat:test`
